        <dt>What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</dt>
        <dd>Web Container or Servlet Container are applications used to manage
            the components like Servlets.It is a part of the web server.

            Web Server is a server which is capable of handling
            HTTP requests, sent by a client and responds back with a HTTP response.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is a servlet?</dt>
        <dd>A servlet is a Java class that extends the capabilities of
            servers that host applications access by means of a
            request-response programming model.</dd>
        <dt>How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?
        </dt>
        <dd>When a HTTP request comes to the web server, it checks is the request
            is for a servlet. If it is, it passes the request data to web/servlet
            container. The servlet cntainer then locates the servlet, creates request
            and response objects and passes them to the servlet and returns to the web
            server the response created by the servlet. The web container then sends the
            response back to the browser to be rendered.</dd>
        <dt>Who creates request objects?</dt>
        <Dd>Servlet/web container creates request objects.</Dd>
        <dt>What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</dt>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>Load servlet class</li>
                <li>Instantiate servlet </li>
                <li>initialize called only once in the servlet's life</li>
                <li>service() (called for each request, each request runs in separate thread)</li>
                <li>destroy() (called only once)</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>Who calls init and when?</dt>
        <Dd>Servlet container calls init only once in the servlet's life.
        </Dd>
        <Dt>Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?
        </Dt>
        <dd>doGet should be overridden. init possibly if we have initialization code
        </dd>
        <dt>In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?
        </dt>
        <Dd>Multiple requests to the same servlet can be executed at the same time which
            means they are multi-threaded.
        </Dd>
        <dt>What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?
        </dt>
        <dd>Although servlets are multithreaded, the container does not create
            a new instance of the Servlet class for each request and
            reuses an existing one. It means more than one thread can be accessing
            the same instance variable at the same time. This is why they are not thread safe.</dd>
