    <dl>
        <dt>Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</dt>
        <dd>In the POST method the data is passed in the HTTP request body so it can't
            be bookmarked because bookmarking only saves the URL and not the request body.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the purpose of request dispatching?
        </dt>
        <dd>The purpose of request dispatching is to internally pass the requst processing
            to another local resource or to tell the client browser to issue another http
            request to a specified URL.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Request dispatch is used to pass the request to another resource for further processing within the same
            server,
            another resource could be any servlet, jsp page any kind of file.
            Redirect is used to redirect client request to some other location for further processing ,the new location
            is available on different server or different context
            <br><br>
            During request dispatch browser is completely unaware of servlet forward and hence the URL
            in browser address bar will remain unchanged whereas
            during redirect this request is visible in browser as a new request.
            <br><br>Request dispatch is also called server side redirect whereas
            redirect is called client side redirect.
            <br><br>
            With request dispatch, request and response
            objects are passed to destination servlet whereas in redirect, only http message is sent.

        </dd>
        <dt>What is an attribute ?
        </dt>
        <dd>Attributes are name value pair objects bound into one of the three servlet API objects; HttpServletRequest, 
            HttpSession, ServletContext</dd>
        <dt>What is the difference between attributes and parameters?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Attributes are server variables that exists within a specified scope in application, session or requests
            whereas parameters are string values passed from client to server. 
            <br><br>
            Attributes are set in a servlet for the same request and is accessible 
            from JSP and can be any object including string. Parameters are set and passed
            from client to server and can only return strings.
        </dd>
        <dt>What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</dt>
        <dd>
                HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that after a web
                server responds to a request, there is no “memory” of the
                request or who sent it. Every resource that is accessed via HTTP is a single 
                request with no threaded connection between them.

                FTP(File Transfer Protocol) is an example stateful protocol. It saves the status and 
                session information. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
            method).</dt>
        <dd>
            <ol>
                <li>request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing request </li>
                <li>session scope: destroyed when user closes browser</li>
                <li>application scope destroyed when Container stopped.</li>
                <li>Cookies saved on browser, temporary or permanent</li>
                <li>Hidden fields on a form</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>How long does a session last?</dt>
        <dd>Sessins last as long as the declared value of session-timeout in web.xml. 
                getMaxInactiveInterval  method tells how long sessions last.</dd>
        <dt>What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</dt>
        <dd>Temporary cookies are deleted when the browser is closed. 
            Permanent cookies has a max age set so it lasts until that time.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</dt>
        <dd>URL rewriting helps alter the parameters in a URL.</dd>
        <dt>Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</dt>
        <dd>If the server finishes processing request, the request attribute will report null.</dd>
    </dl>
